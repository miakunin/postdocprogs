# User guide 
## Compiling the model and creating a project
The only prerequisite to install LAKE model is Fortran compiler.
The model can be built from source code by GNU and Intel Fortran compilers. GNU compiler is set by default in the model install configuration. Install configuration is given in files [Makefile](/../blob/master/Makefile) and [source/Makefile](/../blob/master/source/Makefile).  
If you want to use Intel compiler, you have to change variable `FC` value to `FC = ifort` in these files.  
Once you unpack the LAKE model archive or cloned its git project just type in the model root folder  
```
user@computer:~/LAKE/lake$ make all
```
to build the model from the source code. The next step is to configure the
model for you needs. This means that you create a project, identified
by the project name hereafter we will refer to it as ```project_name```,
it may be any text, e.g. combination of the lake name and the time span you need to simulate this lake, for instance, "Valkea-Kotinen2006"). Once you've chosen the project name, type
```
user@computer:~/LAKE/lake$ ./crproj <project_name>
```

This creates the folder structure in `./results`, to which the output
files will be written. After that, create `./setup/project_name_driver.dat` and `./setup/project_name_setup.dat` files. These files must have
a certain structure, so that we recommend that you create them by copying from
sample files already existing in `./setup`. Once copied, you can modify them appropriately. This is what the next two sections are devoted to.

To run the model you have to provide a file with meteorological data. It must be an ASCII table, where each column contains a time series of a certain meteorological variable. A sequence of columns is set in `/setup/project_name_driver.dat`. Shortly after start, the model will seek the file with meteorological data as `./data/project_name.dat`.

## Configuring the driver file
Driver file is used to set the outer environment of the LAKE model
that is normally the atmospheric model. This means, that atmospheric
model calculates the atmospheric forcing for the LAKE model, and some
external parameters are also being passed to the LAKE model through
the driver interface. When the LAKE model is coupled to atmospheric 
model the driver file is not needed.  
The format of the driver file is following. Each string of the file
starts with a comment (indicated by `#`) or with a keyword. The last
string of the file contains the keyword `end`. The keywords may
be listed in any order, but we recommend to keep them in thematic groups,
as it is done in sample files. Each keyword, excepting `end`, must 
have a value that is set after the keyword at the same string separated
by at least one space. Some keywords are followed by a group of numbers.

## Running the model
The model is launched by typing in the terminal
```
user@computer:~/LAKE/lake$ ./lake.out
```

However, it usually happen that you need to run the model with different configurations (input parameters). In this case we recommend to use the script `launch` in a root folder. To run the model you invoke this script with an argument specifying the experiment label
```
user@computer:~/LAKE/lake$ ./launch <project_name>_<spec>
```
for instance
```
user@computer:~/LAKE/lake$ ./launch Valkea-Kotinen2006_base
```
This script does the following. It runs the model, the model writes output data to `results/Valkea-Kotinen2006`, then the script creates `results/Valkea-Kotinen2006_base` and copies there the content of `results/Valkea-Kotinen2006`, `setup/Valkea-Kotinen2006_setup.dat` and `setup/Valkea-Kotinen2006_driver.dat`. As a result, both model output and configuration files of an experiment labeled as `base` are written in a specific directory, so you will not mix them with that from other experiments. 

## Model output
The model output is written in `./results/project_name` folder.
```
user@computer:~/LAKE/lake/results/project\_name$ ls
daily  everystep  hourly  monthly  netcdf  time_series
user@computer:~/LAKE/lake/results/project\_name$
```
The folders `hourly`, `daily`, `monthly` contain vertical profiles
of different variables in a lake, averaged over respective time intervals. Output files in netCDF format are being placed in `netcdf` folder, and files 
with time series - in `time_series` folder. Sometimes, for debugging purposes,
it is advantageous to use the output at every time step of the model's numerical scheme, the respective files reside in `time_series`
